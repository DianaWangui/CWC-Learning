The ("%[^\n]%*c",....) used in scanf function to print string is mostly used to exclude spaces and new line characters entered by the user when taking input,
The %*c means that you dont assign any value to the variable until you hit enter button on your keyboard. 
Whenever this expression is used in scanf it allows every characted enterd by the user including spaces to be printed out along with the other characters entered. I t like reads the spaces as character also is simple terms and not as null terminator or new line characters, until one hits enter.
