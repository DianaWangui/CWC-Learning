1.a) A variable is like a container that is used in c programming to store data in memory. 
  b) In C programming unlike other programming languages like python you have to declare a variable first before storing an data in memory. 
This variable will act as a storage space for the value that one will assign to it. These variables are of different types, and this types depends on the data the user wants to store.
There are a couple of these data types like integers (int), characaters (char), floating (float), pointers among others.
Example if one wants to store there age in the computer memory they will use int data type because age is a number. They will basically initialize it like:
	- int age = 40; This will assign a memory space called age and store value 40 in it. To be able to access this value one will just use the variable name age, to access it.
2. In a 64 bit machine this are the various data type size:
	-int is 4 bytes
	-char is 1 byte
	-float is 4 bytes
	-pointers are 4 bytes
  In a 32 bit machine this are the data type size:
	-int is 4 bypes
	- char is 1 byte
	-pointers are 8 bytes
	-float are 4 bytes
There are also other types for int that is, short int, long int and long long int.
Short int in both 64 bit and 32 bits are 2 bytes in size. In a 64 bit long and lon long int are 8 bytes and in a 32 bit machine long int is 4 bytes
